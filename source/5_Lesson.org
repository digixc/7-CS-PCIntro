- During Computer Science lessons, you are required to submit your work online to be marked by your teachers.
- The place you upload your work is www.bournetolearn.com

** Step 1: Prepare your work for uploading

- If you have work that is only one page long, it would be best to take a screenshot of it and upload as image.
- Regardless of screenshot or not, you need to save your work in its original format/file type.  For examples, you wrote one page in Microsoft Word, you MUST save it as a ".docx" file first so when you teacher gives your feedback on how to improve, you can open it again in Word and edit it.
- Always save your work using meaningful file name, such as "week1-silver", "hangmanGame" etc.
- You can take a screenshot using the software called "snipping tool":
